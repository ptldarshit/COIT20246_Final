Task 4

A)  With a VPN, you can get around geolocation restrictions to access websites that are only available in other countries, browse the internet privately and securely, and get around content filtering or censorship. On the other hand, there are several reasons not to use a VPN to get around geolocation services, including breaking the terms of service of web service providers, the possibility of legal problems depending on the country and the use of the VPN, and the possibility of a slower internet connection due to the VPN's additional encryption and routeing.

B)  Universities may consider using IP addresses as a helpful tool to stop academic dishonesty by looking for potential contract cheating. However, there are a number of arguments against this strategy as well. When a person uses a VPN or connects to the internet from a public Wi-Fi hotspot, for instance, their IP address may not always correctly reflect their location. It's also possible for IP addresses to be shared, making it challenging to pinpoint exactly who submitted an assessment. Additionally, relying solely on IP addresses could result in erroneous accusations and harm to students' reputations.

C)  The advantages and disadvantages of utilising a VPN while studying in Australia should be carefully considered by prospective students. They should balance the potential advantages of using web services that are only accessible in their home country or safeguarding their privacy and security against the risks of breaking web service providers' terms of service, running afoul of the law, or possibly even having their internet speed reduced. Students also need to be informed of any potential repercussions for breaking the university's VPN usage restrictions as well as the policies itself.
